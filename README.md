# Classify credit data using decision trees

Project made for the UOC's Data Mining subject (PAC3).

The objective of this small data mining project was to use decision trees like Quinlan C5.0 and Random Forest to determine whether one person would be able to pay their credit or not.

The final report can be open using a browser. The R-Markdown code can be executed and modified using R-Studio.
